    <h1>Ustad Zakir Hussain tribute: Tabla loses its vibrant voice</h1><br>
    <p>The tabla fell silent as Ustad Zakir Hussain (1951-2024), one of the greatest global ambassadors of Indian
        classical music, passed away on Monday (December 16, 2024) after a brief illness in San Francisco, California. A
        maestro who transformed the modest instrument into a robust voice for universal peace and humanity, Hussain's
        incredible speed, dexterity, and creativity mesmerised audiences across cultures. Having grown up singing odes
        to Mother Saraswati, verses of the holy Quran, and hymns of the Bible as a daily ritual, India’s syncretic soul
        echoed through Hussain’s rhythmic art. With a flair for carving stories out of percussive sound, his
        conversational music buzzed with a spark of spontaneity. Natural flow defined his music and personality. The
        Padma Vibhushan would impress the purists, enthrall the seekers of fusion, and handhold the fans of Bollywood
        music into his creative space with equal felicity. At the peak of his creativity genius, he bagged three Grammys
        in one night this February. Like his carefully designed free-flowing style, the versatile artist would execute
        complex rhythms, intricate patterns, and nuanced dynamics and then move on to items like the sound of traffic
        signal and deer’s walk, without putting music into brackets. In tune with technology, over the years, he
        experimented with frequencies to highlight the subtle shades of the instrument to establish that tabla is not
        just a rhythmic instrument but also a melodic one. He emerged on the scene alongside eminent tabla artists like
        Anindo Chatterjee, Shafaat Ahmed Khan, Kumar Bose, and Swapan Chaudhuri, but Hussain’s role in popularising
        tabla and providing it a global platform remains unparalleled.

    <p>Born to Ustad Alla Rakha, the eminent accompanist of Pandit Ravi Shankar, credited with taking tabla to foreign
        shores, tabla chose Hussain. He grew up in Mumbai in an environment where his father believed that every
        instrument has its spirit. Hussain befriended the tabla at the age of three and by the time he hit teenage, the
        instrument had become his muse for life and perhaps an extension of his personality. After watching him play,
        one couldn’t see playing tabla as a chore in classical music. His other two brothers, Taufiq and Fazal, are also
        noted percussionists but Hussain took his father’s legacy to the next level by adding a touch of showmanship and
        expanding the riches he inherited from the Punjab gharana. A keen learner and listener, Hussain was like a
        responsive satellite in orbit as an accompanist, shone like a star in his solos, and reserved the adventurous
        streak of a meteor for creating fusion music.
