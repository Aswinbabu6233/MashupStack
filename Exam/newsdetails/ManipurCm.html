    <h1>Manipur CM condemns killing of Bihar migrant labourers, announces ex-gratia of ₹10 lakh</h1><br>
    <p>Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh has strongly condemned the killing of two migrant labourers from Bihar in
        Kakching district and announced an ex-gratia of ₹10 lakh for the next of kin of the two deceased.He said every
        possible effort is underway to identify, apprehend, and prosecute those responsible for killing the two migrant
        labourers
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Singh in a post on X said, <q> I strongly condemn the brutal killing of young brothers, Sunalal
            Kumar (18) and Dasharat Kumar (17), from Bihar in Kakching district, Manipur. This act of terrorism is a
            direct assault on our values, and my deepest condolences go out to their grieving families.</q></p>
    <p><q>In this
            crucial juncture, we cannot ignore the possibility that this horrific crime is part of a larger conspiracy
            to destabilise our state and push it further towards chaos. We must stand together against these destructive
            forces and ensure that they do not succeed in creating fear and insecurity,</q>he added. The Manipur CM also
        announced ₹10 lakh ex gratia for the bereaved family and said the case would be transferred to NIA, if needed.
