    <h1>Gukesh is youngest world chess champion
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>History was made on the small island of Sentosa in Singapore on Thursday (December 12, 2024), as D. Gukesh became
        the youngest world chess champion ever after defeating Ding Liren of China in the final game of their match. The
        18-year-old from Chennai broke the record held by the Russian Garry Kasparov for nearly four decades.With his
        victory against the defending champion, which came after 58 moves, Gukesh took his points tally to 7.5 points.
        That was the requirement for a player to win the World title. If the 14th game had ended in a draw, a series of
        tie-breaker games of speed chess were scheduled to be played on Friday (December 13, 2024). The game was heading
        towards a draw in fact, until Ding made a fatal error on the 55th move with his rook. There was no coming back
        for the Chinese Grandmaster after that.

    <p> This was the first-ever World championship match contested by two Asian countries. And it was a match between
        the players from India and China, the world’s two most populous countries and the continent’s superpowers.
        Gukesh is only the third Asian to win the World championship. Viswanathan Anand, who is now a mentor for Gukesh,
        was the first, and Ding the second. Gukesh is also only the 18th World champion in history, which dates back to
        1886. That there have been only 17 undisputed World champions before him puts into perspective the enormity of
        the achievement.
