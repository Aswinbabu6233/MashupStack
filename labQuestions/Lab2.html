        <div id="Overview">
            <p><strong>In November 2024</strong>, Kerala's liquefied petroleum gas <i>(LPG)</i> market demonstrated a
                period of relative stability for domestic consumers, with prices for 14.2 kg LPG cylinders remaining
                unchanged across major cities. This consistency brought relief to households amidst rising inflationary
                pressures and volatile global energy markets. Domestic pricing stability is attributed to effective
                government interventions, including subsidies aimed at cushioning the impact of international price
                fluctuations and ensuring affordability for consumers. On the other hand, commercial LPG rates showed a
                marginal upward adjustment, reflecting broader trends observed across India due to increasing
                transportation costs and fluctuating crude oil prices. The rise in commercial rates highlights the
                ongoing challenges faced by small businesses and industries that rely heavily on LPG, even as efforts to
                promote cleaner energy solutions remain a priority in the state.</p>
